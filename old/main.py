# This program is a "Keyboard Heatmap" where it will take in a .txt, look at all of the characters, and then
# show you which keys were hit the most on a gradient scale (all keys will be weighted from 0.00 to 1.00, they
# will have a corresponding shade of green to go with, kinda like GitHub tiles).

# TODO Integrate a .txt reader that will scrape all of the characters from it and add to a count for each (maybe with the dict.update() method?)
# TODO Then, put these on a scale from 0.00 to 1.00, and color the keys on the keyboard accordingly.
